VAN: please read the design doc @0001-design.md and initialize the memory bank under ./.cursor/memory

You need to call `pin()` before using it for papaya::HashMap. Now I've fixed it and refactored the db code extensively. Please update your memory and follow my code patterns. Please update @tasks.md to reflect current status and continue with next task

I've fixed the issue. Please update your memory. You should follow the attached example in future on how to use papaya::HashMap. Now please make sure is_pk, is_unique, fk_table, fk_column is implemented.

I've manually moved those docs to ./.cursor/memory. based on your study, update @tasks.md
