# Project Progress: SQL Query Interface

## Current Status

**Phase:** Implementation (Level 3 Plan Active)

**Details:**

-   The detailed design phase is complete (`specs/0001-design.md`).
-   Memory Bank files have been initialized and updated with the Level 3 implementation plan.
-   Backend tasks **B.1** (Project Setup) and **B.2** (Initial Dependencies) are complete.
-   **Task B.3** (Basic Axum server startup & config loading) is complete. Code refactored into `AppConfig`, `AppState`, `get_router`.
-   **Task B.4** (DB Pooling): Implemented in `AppState::new`.
-   **Task B.5** (JWT Auth): Middleware structure implemented.
-   **Task B.6** (`/api/databases`): Endpoint implemented.
-   **Task B.7** (`/api/.../tables`): Endpoint implemented, including refactoring DB logic into `src/db.rs` and `DbPool` methods.
-   **Task B.8** (`/api/.../schema`): Partially implemented (fetches columns). Blocked by `papaya` usage, now resolved. Refactored with `ColumnType` enum. Completed by adding constraint fetching.
-   **Task B.9** (`/api/execute-query`): Endpoint implemented, including refactoring validation and execution logic into `src/db.rs` and `PoolHandler` trait.
-   Implementation is ready to proceed with **Task B.10** (Error Handling / JSON Responses).

## Next Steps

1.  Implement **Task B.10:** Review backend error handling and ensure consistent JSON responses.
2.  Implement **Task B.11:** Configure CORS middleware.
3.  Begin frontend setup (Task F.1) concurrently or subsequently.
