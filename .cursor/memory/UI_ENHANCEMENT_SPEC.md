# SQL Query Interface UI Enhancement Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation details for enhancing the SQL Query Interface with a more intuitive and feature-rich UI. The new design adopts a three-column layout inspired by industry-standard SQL tools like Databricks SQL Editor, with improvements for usability and functionality.

## Design Goals

1. **Improved Information Architecture** - Organize UI elements logically with a focus on user workflow
2. **Enhanced Discoverability** - Make features more discoverable through intuitive navigation
3. **Streamlined Workflow** - Reduce friction in the database query process
4. **Visual Clarity** - Present information clearly with appropriate visual hierarchy
5. **Responsive Design** - Function well across various screen sizes

## Layout Structure

## Detailed Component Specifications

### Column 1: Toolbox Sidebar

#### Design
- Narrow, collapsible sidebar (50-80px expanded, 24px collapsed)
- Vertical arrangement of icon buttons
- Consistent iconography with tooltips
- Visually subdued to avoid competing with main content

#### Components
1. **Action Icons**
   - Save query
   - Query history
   - Settings/preferences
   - Help/documentation

2. **User Controls**
   - User profile/authentication status
   - Workspace selector (if applicable)

### Column 2: Catalog Browser

#### Design
- Fixed-width column (280-320px) with resize handle
- Hierarchical tree structure for navigation
- Search filter at top with immediate visual feedback
- Context actions for schema elements

#### Components
1. **Search & Control Bar**
   - Search input with clear button
   - Refresh button with loading indicator
   - View options toggle (if needed)

2. **Tree Navigator**
   - Three-level hierarchy:
     - Database level (expandable)
     - Table level (expandable)
     - Field level (clickable for details)
   - Visual indicators for:
     - Primary keys (key icon)
     - Foreign keys (link icon)
     - Field data types (type-specific icons)
   - Context menu for common actions

3. **Field Detail Popup**
   - Appears on field click
   - Displays:
     - Data type with full details
     - Constraints (NULL/NOT NULL, etc.)
     - Foreign key relationships
     - Description/comments (if available)
     - Usage statistics (if available)

### Column 3: SQL Editor & Results

#### Design
- Occupies remaining screen space (fluid width)
- Vertically divided between editor and results
- Resizable split between sections

#### Components
1. **Editor Header**
   - Current database indicator
   - Execute button (primary action)
   - Additional controls (cancel, format, etc.)
   - Editor settings toggle

2. **SQL Editor**
   - Monaco-based editor with enhanced features:
     - Syntax highlighting
     - Auto-completion
     - Error highlighting
     - Schema-aware suggestions
   - Line numbers and fold controls
   - Drop target for drag-and-drop from catalog

3. **Results Panel**
   - Tabbed interface for multiple result sets
   - Toggle between table and visualization views
   - Table features:
     - Sortable columns
     - Client-side filtering

## Interaction Patterns

### Navigation Flow
1. **Selection Process**
   - User selects database from catalog
   - User expands tables to view fields
   - User can click fields to view details or drag to editor

2. **Query Execution**
   - User writes/edits SQL in editor
   - User executes query with button or keyboard shortcut
   - Loading indicator appears during execution
   - Results displayed in result panel upon completion

3. **Results Interaction**
   - User can toggle between table/visualization views
   - User can sort/filter table data
   - User can export results in various formats

### Supported Interactions
- **Drag and Drop**: Fields from catalog to editor
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: For common operations
- **Context Menus**: For additional actions
- **Tooltips**: For discoverability
- **Inline Help**: For complex features

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (>1200px)
- Full three-column layout
- All features visible

### Tablet (768px-1200px)
- Toolbox collapses to icons only
- Catalog can be toggled/collapsed
- Editor takes priority in space allocation

### Mobile (<768px)
- Single column view with navigation controls
- Focus on one component at a time
- Simplified UI with core functionality

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support for keyboard-only usage
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG AA standards
- **Text Sizing**: Support for browser text zoom
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus states

## Visual Design

### Color Palette
- Primary actions: Blue (#0066cc)
- Secondary elements: Gray scale
- Status indicators: Success (green), Warning (yellow), Error (red)
- Background: Light theme (white/light gray) and dark theme support

### Typography
- System font stack for performance
- Base size: 14px for content, 12px for auxiliary text
- Monospace font for SQL editor (Consolas, Monaco, etc.)

### Iconography
- Consistent icon set for all UI controls
- Database-specific icons for data types
- Status indicator icons for feedback

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- Use shadcn/ui components as foundation
- Extend with custom components as needed
- Maintain consistent props API

### State Management
- Continue using Zustand for global state
- Component-local state for UI-specific concerns
- Consider adding slices for new features

### Performance Considerations
- Virtualized lists for large schemas
- Debounced search inputs
- Lazy loading for visualization components
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

## Future Considerations

- Query parameter support
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced visualization options
- AI-assisted query generation
- Schema comparison tools
